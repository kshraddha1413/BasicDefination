**What is Spring Boot?**

Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup.

Advantages

Spring Boot offers the following advantages to its developers −

Easy to understand and develop spring applications
Increases productivity
Reduces the development time


Why Spring Boot?
You can choose Spring Boot because of the features and benefits it offers as given here −

It provides a flexible way to configure Java Beans, XML configurations, and Database Transactions.

It provides a powerful batch processing and manages REST endpoints.

In Spring Boot, everything is auto configured; no manual configurations are needed.

It offers annotation-based spring application

Eases dependency management

It includes Embedded Servlet Container

How does it work?
Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project by using @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation. For example, if MySQL database is on your classpath, but you have not configured any database connection, then Spring Boot auto-configures an in-memory database.

The entry point of the spring boot application is the class contains @SpringBootApplication annotation and the main method.

Spring Boot automatically scans all the components included in the project by using @ComponentScan annotation.

**Git/Git nub**

Git is a VCS — Version Control System. What that really means is, Git helps us manage our project files.
In short, Git is Version Control System and GitHub is a hosting service for Git Repositories.

GitHub is a web-based service for version control using Git. Basically, it is a social networking site for developers. 
You can look at other people’s code, identify issues with their code and even propose changes. 
This also helps you in improving your code. On a lighter note, 
it is a great place to show off your projects and get noticed by potential recruiters.


REST or RESTful API design (Representational State Transfer) is designed to take advantage of existing protocols. While REST can be used over nearly any protocol, 
it usually takes advantage of HTTP methods GET,PUT,POST,DELETE.
